Create a Login Form that allows users to log in, remember their credentials, and log in as an existing user if credentials are saved.

Requirements
1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML Structure
The login form should contain the following elements:

üîπ Heading:
The page should have an h1 element with the text "Login Form".
üîπ Form Fields:
A username input field:
Type: text
Placeholder: "Username"
ID: username
A password input field:
Type: password
Placeholder: "Password"
ID: password
A "Remember Me" checkbox:
Type: checkbox
ID: checkbox
Label: "Remember me."
A submit button:
Type: submit
ID: submit
Value: "Submit"
üîπ Existing User Login Button:
This button should be hidden initially and only appear if credentials are saved in localStorage.
ID: existing
Text: "Login as existing user"
2Ô∏è‚É£ Functionality
‚úÖ Form Submission Behavior
When the submit button (#submit) is clicked:

Display an alert:
alert("Logged in as <username>");
If the "Remember Me" checkbox (#checkbox) is checked:
Store the username and password in localStorage.
If the checkbox is unchecked:
Remove any previously stored credentials from localStorage.
‚úÖ Persisting Login Data
If credentials are saved in localStorage, display the "Login as existing user" (#existing) button.
When this button is clicked, display:
alert("Logged in as <saved username>");
üîç Edge Cases to Consider
The "Remember Me" functionality should persist across page reloads.
If a user logs in without checking "Remember Me," the credentials should not be saved.
If a user unchecks "Remember Me" and submits, previously saved credentials should be removed.
üß™ Test Cases (Mapped to Cypress)
üîπ 1. Checking Initial Form Display
Ensure the form is present on the page (<form>).
Ensure input fields (#username, #password) are empty on page load.
The checkbox (#checkbox) should be unchecked by default.
The submit button (#submit) should exist.
The "Login as existing user" button (#existing) should not be visible initially.
üîπ 2. Submitting Without "Remember Me"
Enter a username & password and submit without checking the checkbox.
Alert should display "Logged in as <username>".
localStorage should not store the credentials.
üîπ 3. Submitting With "Remember Me" Checked
Enter a username & password, check the "Remember Me" box, and submit.
Credentials should be stored in localStorage.
Reload the page and ensure the "Login as existing user" (#existing) button is visible.
üîπ 4. Logging in as Existing User
If credentials are stored, clicking "Login as existing user" should show an alert:
alert("Logged in as <saved username>");
üéØ Expected Behavior Summary
Action	Expected Outcome
Page loads initially	Form is displayed, fields are empty, "Login as existing user" is hidden
Enter username & password, submit without "Remember Me"	Alert appears, credentials are not stored
Enter username & password, submit with "Remember Me"	Alert appears, credentials are stored in localStorage
Reload page after storing credentials	"Login as existing user" button appears
Click "Login as existing user"	Alert appears with saved username

Develop a web page that displays a list of products and allows users to add products to their shopping cart. The cart data should be stored in sessionStorage, ensuring that the user's shopping cart persists even if they leave the page and return later.

Requirements
1Ô∏è‚É£ Display Products
Upon page load, display a list of 5 products with the following details:
Product Name
Price
Add to Cart button next to each product.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Products to Cart
When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button for any product:
The product should be added to the shopping cart list, showing the product name and price.
The cart should reflect the items that have been added.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Session Storage
The cart data should be stored in sessionStorage:
The cart data should persist across page reloads.
Each time a product is added, the cart data should be updated in sessionStorage, reflecting the current state of the cart.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Cart
Provide a "Clear Cart" button:
When clicked, the cart is cleared, and sessionStorage is updated to reflect the empty cart state.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Persistence on Reload
Upon reloading the page:
If products have been added to the cart in a previous session, they should still appear in the cart.
If the cart is cleared, the cart should be empty upon page reload.
Example Scenarios
Example 1: Initial Product Display
Upon loading the page, the user should see a list of 5 available products, each with a name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Example 2: Adding Products to Cart
The user clicks the "Add to Cart" button next to "Product 1".
The item "Product 1" with its price is added to the shopping cart.
The user clicks the "Add to Cart" button next to "Product 3".
The item "Product 3" is added to the shopping cart.
Example 3: Session Storage Persistence
The user adds "Product 2" to the cart.
The user leaves the page and returns later.
The shopping cart should still display "Product 2", confirming session storage persistence.
Example 4: Clearing the Cart
The user clicks the "Clear Cart" button.
The shopping cart is emptied, and the display is updated accordingly.
Session storage should reflect the empty cart state.
üéØ Test Case Guidelines
Below are some important tags and instructions that should be used in your implementation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Products
Use the h1 tag to display a heading like "Products".
Display the list of products in an unordered list (ul), each product in a list item (li).
Make sure the "Add to Cart" buttons are included with each product (button tags).
Initially, the cart should be empty (ul#cart-list should have no child elements).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Product to Cart
When a product's "Add to Cart" button is clicked, the cart (ul#cart-list) should update to show the added product.
Each product added to the cart should be displayed in the cart list as a li element.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Session Storage
When a product is added, ensure the cart data is saved in sessionStorage (use window.sessionStorage).
The cart data should be in the format of a JSON object that includes product details like id, name, and price.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Cart Button
Implement a "Clear Cart" button (button#clear-cart-btn).
When clicked, the cart should be emptied, and the sessionStorage should be updated accordingly.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Persistence
On page reload, check that previously added items from sessionStorage are still present in the cart.
If the cart was cleared, ensure that sessionStorage is empty.

Your current code has a few issues that might be causing the problem:

Issues:
Inconsistent Use of Quotes:

The provided code is using curly quotes (‚Äú ‚Äù) instead of straight quotes (" ") in getElementById, sessionStorage.getItem, and other places. This can cause syntax errors.
Incorrect Handling of addToCart() Function:

The function is pushing the entire product object into the cart array, not just the product ID. This is fine, but addToCart(productId) should instead pass the entire product object correctly.
The existing code attempts to push productId instead of product, but later tries to access item.id, item.name, and item.price from it. That‚Äôs inconsistent.
Duplicate Items in the Cart:

If a product is added multiple times, it seems to be duplicated more than expected in session storage.
Fixed Code
Try this corrected version:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Product data
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Product 1", price: 10 },
  { id: 2, name: "Product 2", price: 20 },
  { id: 3, name: "Product 3", price: 30 },
  { id: 4, name: "Product 4", price: 40 },
  { id: 5, name: "Product 5", price: 50 },
];

// DOM elements
const productList = document.getElementById("product-list");
const cartList = document.getElementById("cart-list");
const clearBtn = document.getElementById("clear-cart-btn");

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  products.forEach((product) => {
    const li = document.createElement("li");
    li.textContent = `${product.name} - $${product.price}`;
    
    const addToCartBtn = document.createElement("button");
    addToCartBtn.textContent = "Add To Cart";
    
    addToCartBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      addToCart(product); // Pass full product object
    });

    li.appendChild(addToCartBtn);
    productList.appendChild(li);
  });

  renderCart(); // Load cart when page loads
});

function addToCart(product) {
  let cart = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("cart")) || [];

  // Prevent duplicates if necessary
  const existingItem = cart.find((item) => item.id === product.id);
  if (!existingItem) {
    cart.push(product);
  }

  sessionStorage.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart));
  renderCart();
}

// Render cart list
function renderCart() {
  let cart = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("cart")) || [];
  cartList.innerHTML = ""; // Clear cart display before re-rendering

  cart.forEach((item) => {
    const li = document.createElement("li");
    li.textContent = `${item.name} - $${item.price}`;
    cartList.appendChild(li);
  });
}

// Clear cart
clearBtn.addEventListener("click", clearCart);
function clearCart() {
  sessionStorage.removeItem("cart");
  renderCart();
}
Fixes and Improvements
‚úÖ Fixed Quote Issues:

Replaced curly quotes with straight quotes (" ") for getElementById, sessionStorage, etc.
‚úÖ Fixed addToCart() Issue:

Now passes the full product object to the function instead of just product.id.
‚úÖ Fixed Duplicate Cart Items Issue:

Ensures a product is added only once to avoid unnecessary duplicates.
‚úÖ Fixed renderCart() Logic:

Properly clears and re-renders the cart instead of appending duplicate items.
Expected Behavior
üîπ Clicking "Add to Cart" will add an item to the session storage and display it in the cart.
üîπ On page reload, items persist in the cart.
üîπ Clicking "Clear Cart" removes items from both session storage and UI.

This should fix your sessionStorage timeout issue and ensure the cart behaves correctly! üöÄ Let me know if you need any modifications! üòä






You said:
In this task, you will create a JavaScript object called student with a property called name. You will then write a function called getKeys() that accepts an object and returns an array of all its keys.

Task Breakdown
Create an Object:

The object should have a property called name.
Create a Function (getKeys):

The function should accept an object as an argument and return an array of all the keys present in that object.
Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to create the student object and the getKeys() function:

// Create the student object
const student = {
  name: "John",
};

// Function to get all keys from the object
function getKeys(obj) {
  return Object.keys(obj);
}

// Testing the function
console.log(getKeys(student)); // Output: ["name"]
Test Explanation
Test 1:
This test checks if getKeys() correctly returns all the keys in an object with multiple properties (name, age, and city).
Test 2:
This test ensures that getKeys() works properly for objects with only one property (in this case, name).
Constraints
The getKeys() function should only return an array of the keys (e.g., ["name", "age", "city"]).
The object passed to getKeys() can have any number of properties (1 or more).
Make sure to use Object.keys() to get the keys of the object.
Notes:
The test code uses Cypress for testing. Ensure that you correctly load and test the script using eval() to dynamically run the JavaScript code.
The getKeys() function uses Object.keys() to extract keys from the object and return them as an array.
This version gives you a full explanation of how to implement and test the getKeys() function, as well as the test cases.
ChatGPT said:
Here's the implementation of the student object and the getKeys() function:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Create the student object
const student = {
  name: "John",
};

// Function to get all keys from the object
function getKeys(obj) {
  return Object.keys(obj);
}

// Testing the function
console.log(getKeys(student)); // Output: ["name"]

// Additional test cases
console.log(getKeys({ name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" })); // Output: ["name", "age", "city"]
console.log(getKeys({ id: 101 })); // Output: ["id"]
console.log(getKeys({})); // Output: []
üîç Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Created a student object with a name property.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented getKeys(obj) using Object.keys(obj), which extracts and returns an array of all the keys.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Tested with multiple cases to ensure it works with different object structures.

‚úÖ Test Cases
Input Object	Expected Output
{ name: "John" }	["name"]
{ name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" }	["name", "age", "city"]
{ id: 101 }	["id"]
{}	[]
This implementation meets all requirements and should pass the Cypress tests! üöÄ Let me know if you need modifications. üòä

ChatGPT said:
It looks like Cypress is expecting getKeys to be a method of an object (myObj.getKeys()) rather than a standalone function.

‚úÖ Fix
You need to attach getKeys as a method of student instead of defining it separately.

üîß Fixed Code
javascript
Copy
Edit
// Define student object with a method getKeys
let student = {
  name: "Neha",
  top: "67",
  getKeys: function () {
    return Object.keys(this); // 'this' refers to student object
  }
};

// Testing the function
console.log(student.getKeys()); // Output: ["name", "top", "getKeys"]
üîç Why This Fix Works?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Cypress is looking for myObj.getKeys(), so we define getKeys inside student.
2Ô∏è‚É£ this inside getKeys() refers to the student object.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The function now correctly returns an array of all keys in student.

üöÄ Expected Output
javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log(student.getKeys());

Now, your Cypress test should pass! ‚úÖ

You said:
write code in js In this task, you will create a JavaScript object called student with a property called name. You will then write a function called getKeys() that accepts an object and returns an array of all its keys.

Task Breakdown
Create an Object:

The object should have a property called name.
Create a Function (getKeys):

The function should accept an object as an argument and return an array of all the keys present in that object.
Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to create the student object and the getKeys() function:

// Create the student object
const student = {
  name: "John",
};

// Function to get all keys from the object
function getKeys(obj) {
  return Object.keys(obj);
}

// Testing the function
console.log(getKeys(student)); // Output: ["name"]
Test Explanation
Test 1:
This test checks if getKeys() correctly returns all the keys in an object with multiple properties (name, age, and city).
Test 2:
This test ensures that getKeys() works properly for objects with only one property (in this case, name).
Constraints
The getKeys() function should only return an array of the keys (e.g., ["name", "age", "city"]).
The object passed to getKeys() can have any number of properties (1 or more).
Make sure to use Object.keys() to get the keys of the object.
Notes:
The test code uses Cypress for testing. Ensure that you correctly load and test the script using eval() to dynamically run the JavaScript code.
The getKeys() function uses Object.keys() to extract keys from the object and return them as an array.
This version gives you a full explanation of how to implement and test the getKeys() function, as well as the test cases.

üîç Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Created the student object with a property "name".

You said:
write code in js Create a table that displays the results of three promises, each resolving after a random delay between 1 and 3 seconds. You will use Promise.all() to wait for all promises to resolve, and then populate the table with the results, showing how long each promise took to resolve.

Requirements
1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML Table Structure
You will have a table with an empty body (<tbody id="output">), and by default, it will contain a row with Loading... spanning 2 columns. This is used to indicate that the promises are in progress.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Promises
Create 3 promises, each of which will resolve after a random time between 1 and 3 seconds. The promise should resolve with a value that indicates the time taken (in seconds).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Populating the Table
After all the promises resolve using Promise.all(), remove the "Loading..." row and populate the table with the following rows:

Row 1:

First column: Promise 1
Second column: The time it took to resolve (between 1 and 3 seconds, e.g., 2).
Row 2:

First column: Promise 2
Second column: The time it took to resolve (between 1 and 3 seconds, e.g., 1).
Row 3:

First column: Promise 3
Second column: The time it took to resolve (between 1 and 3 seconds, e.g., 3).
Row 4:

First column: Total
Second column: The total time it took for all promises to resolve, which should be the time the longest promise took (e.g., 3.006).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Details
Default Row: Initially, there should be a row with the text Loading... spanning two columns to indicate that the promises are still resolving.

Promise.all(): Once all the promises are resolved, the loading text should disappear, and the table should be updated with the results from each promise.

Example Table After Promises Resolve
Promise	Time Taken (Seconds)
Promise 1	2
Promise 2	1
Promise 3	3
Total	3.006
Test Case Guidance
1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Empty Table
Ensure the table is initially empty with just the "Loading..." message.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Loading Text
Verify that the "Loading..." message appears while waiting for promises to resolve.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Promise Resolution
Wait for the promises to resolve and verify that the table has been populated correctly, with each promise showing its resolved time, and the total row displaying the correct maximum time.
Additional Notes:
Ensure Promise Timing: Ensure that the promises resolve randomly between 1 and 3 seconds.
Formatting: Use toFixed(3) for the time values to match the format expected (e.g., 2.000).
Remove Loading: The loading row should be removed once the promises have resolved and the results are displayed.

In this assignment, you'll work with JavaScript constructor functions and prototypes. You need to create two constructor functions: Car and SportsCar. SportsCar will inherit from Car and include additional functionality specific to sports cars.

Objective
Create a Car constructor function with properties make and model. Then, create a SportsCar constructor function that inherits from Car and adds an additional property topSpeed. Both constructor functions will have methods to return specific information about the car.

Requirements
1. Car Constructor
Create a constructor function called Car.
The Car constructor should accept two arguments:
make (string): The car's make (e.g., "Toyota").
model (string): The car's model (e.g., "Corolla").
Add a method to the Car prototype:
getMakeModel(): Returns a string combining make and model in the format "make model".
2. SportsCar Constructor
Create a constructor function called SportsCar that inherits from Car.

The SportsCar constructor should accept three arguments:

make (string): The car's make.
model (string): The car's model.
topSpeed (number): The top speed of the sports car in miles per hour.
Add a method to the SportsCar prototype:

getTopSpeed(): Returns the top speed of the sports car.
Ensure SportsCar inherits from Car's prototype.

Example Code
Here‚Äôs an example to guide you:

// Create a new SportsCar instance
const car = new SportsCar("Ferrari", "Testarossa", 200);

// Call getMakeModel() to get the make and model of the car
console.log(car.getMakeModel()); // Output: Ferrari Testarossa

// Call getTopSpeed() to get the top speed of the sports car
console.log(car.getTopSpeed()); // Output: 200
Test Cases
Here are the key test cases you should expect your solution to pass:

Inheritance from Car prototype:

The SportsCar class should inherit from the Car prototype.
Make and Model Properties:

A SportsCar instance should have the correct make and model properties, accessible via car.make and car.model.
Top Speed Property:

A SportsCar instance should have the correct topSpeed property.
getMakeModel Method:

The getMakeModel() method should return a string containing the make and model of the car, formatted like "make model".
getTopSpeed Method:

The getTopSpeed() method should return the topSpeed value of the SportsCar.
Expected Output
For a SportsCar instance like the one in the example:

const car = new SportsCar("Ferrari", "Testarossa", 200);
console.log(car.getMakeModel()); // Output: Ferrari Testarossa
console.log(car.getTopSpeed()); // Output: 200
Notes:
The SportsCar constructor function must properly inherit from the Car prototype.
Pay close attention to how methods are added to the prototype of each constructor.
You can test your solution using the provided Cypress test cases (included in the original description) to ensure your code behaves as expected.

};

// Example Usage
const car = new SportsCar("Ferrari", "Testarossa", 200);
console.log(car.getMakeModel()); // Output: Ferrari Testarossa

In this task, you'll create a simple class hierarchy with an Animal class and two subclasses: Cat and Dog. Each class will have specific behaviors, and you'll define methods that log messages to the console. This program will be tested using Cypress to verify its correctness.

Objective
Create an Animal class that stores a species and provides a method for the animal to make a sound. Then, create two subclasses, Cat and Dog, that extend Animal and add their specific behaviors.

Requirements
1. Animal Class
Constructor:

constructor(species: string)
The constructor accepts a single argument species (string) to specify the species of the animal.
Getter:

species: string - This getter method should return the species of the animal.
Method:

makeSound(): void - This method logs a message to the console in the following format:
The <species> makes a sound
2. Cat Class
Inherits from the Animal class.

Method:

purr(): void - This method logs "purr" to the console when called.
3. Dog Class
Inherits from the Animal class.

Method:

bark(): void - This method logs "woof" to the console when called.
Example Code
Here‚Äôs an example of how the classes should behave:

// Creating an instance of Cat
const myCat = new Cat("Siamese");
myCat.makeSound();
// Expected Output: The Siamese makes a sound

myCat.purr();
// Expected Output: purr

// Creating an instance of Dog
const myDog = new Dog("Golden Retriever");
myDog.makeSound();
// Expected Output: The Golden Retriever makes a sound

myDog.bark();
// Expected Output: woof
Test Cases
Here are the key Cypress test cases that you should expect your solution to pass:

1. Cat Species Test
When you create a Cat instance with species "Siamese" and call the makeSound() method, the console output should be:

The Siamese makes a sound
When you call the purr() method on the Cat instance, the console output should be:

purr
2. Dog Species Test
When you create a Dog instance with species "Golden Retriever" and call the makeSound() method, the console output should be:

The Golden Retriever makes a sound
When you call the bark() method on the Dog instance, the console output should be:

woof
Notes:
The Cat and Dog classes should inherit from the Animal class and should be able to call makeSound() to log the appropriate message.
The purr() method in Cat and the bark() method in Dog should be properly defined and log their respective messages.
Make sure that the species getter returns the correct species name when accessed.

üîπ How was it fixed?
Replaced the getter-only species property with a direct property assignment (this.species = species) inside the constructor.
Added getSpecies() method instead of a getter, since we no longer need a getter-only property.

        console.log(`The ${this._species} makes a sound`);
    }
}

// Cat class inheriting from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
    constructor(species) {
        super(species); // Call the Animal constructor
    }

    // Method to log "purr"
    purr() {
        console.log("purr");
    }
}

// Dog class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(species) {
        super(species); // Call the Animal constructor
    }

    // Method to log "woof"
    bark() {
        console.log("woof");
    }
}

// Example Usage
const myCat = new Cat("Siamese");
myCat.makeSound(); // Output: The Siamese makes a sound
myCat.purr();      // Output: purr
console.log(myCat.species); // Output: Siamese

const myDog = new Dog("Golden Retriever");
myDog.makeSound(); // Output: The Golden Retriever makes a sound
myDog.bark();      // Output: woof
console.log(myDog.species); // Output: Golden Retriever
‚úÖ Fix Explanation
Encapsulation (_species with a getter)

Used _species to store the species internally and created a getter (get species()) to return it.
This ensures the species property behaves as expected without causing a TypeError.
Class Inheritance (extends Animal)

Cat and Dog classes inherit from Animal using extends.
Both call super(species) in their constructors to initialize the species property properly.
Method Implementations (makeSound(), purr(), bark())

makeSound() is defined in the parent class (Animal) and works for both Cat and Dog.
purr() is specific to Cat, and bark() is specific to Dog.

Edit
The Siamese makes a sound
purr

The Golden Retriever makes a sound
woof

In this task, you will create a simple class structure using inheritance, getters, and setters. The main class is Person, and there are two subclasses, Student and Teacher. These classes will manage basic attributes like name and age, and include methods that perform specific actions like study and teach.

The goal is to implement getters and setters to manage the attributes and to extend the functionality of the Person class by creating Student and Teacher subclasses.

Class Definitions
1. Person Class
The Person class should have the following:

Constructor:
constructor(name: string, age: number) - Initializes a new person with a given name (string) and age (number).
Getter:
get name(): string - A getter method to return the name of the person.
Setter:
set age(age: number) - A setter method to update the age of the person.
2. Student Class
The Student class should inherit from the Person class, and add the following method:

Method:
study(): void - Logs a message to the console that indicates the student is studying. The message should be in the format:
<name> is studying
3. Teacher Class
The Teacher class should inherit from the Person class, and add the following method:

Method:
teach(): void - Logs a message to the console that indicates the teacher is teaching. The message should be in the format:
<name> is teaching

// Base Person class
class Person {

    // Getter for name
    get name() {
        return this._name;

// Student class inheriting from Person
class Student extends Person {
